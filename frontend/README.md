### I've created a weapon printing management page that lets the user add a customized weapon to the table or add to table & send to the printer for easier printing flow.

### the table has three options: see customized weapon attachments in the 'i" icon, print the weapon and delete the weapon from the table.

### each weapon sent to print will be added to the notification list (the bell icon at the top right of the page)

## frontend stack: reactjs, vite, typescript, mui, redux
